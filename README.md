# Sphygmo: Minimalist Blood Pressure Monitor

This superbly ugly-looking, simple app uses Parse.com. In process of refactoring. So, troll at your own risk. I bear no responsibility on any psychological harm that may come to you upon looking at these codes.

## Install (WIP)
*Note:* If you want to play around with this, ensure you have a Parse.com account. Update `main.js` with your Application and Javascript keys
Traverse to the root of the repo directory and run:

    npm install

Then run:

    gulp publish
